## General info

The purpose of this project is similiar to my Twitch one but this time I'm using my knowledge of React and Spotify's API to build an application that allow users to search the Spotify database for songs, artist, albums and create a playlist which then can be saved on to their personal spotify account.

## Features

- Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.
- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button.
- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user’s query.
- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a "+" sign on the right side of the track’s display container.
- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a "-" sign on the right side of the track’s display container.
- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
- Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.
